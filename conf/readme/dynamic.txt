HOW TO CONFIG SERVERS TO STORE DYNAMIC DOMAINS?

1. In VHOST config, use the following configuration

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerAdmin <RANDOM>
		DocumentRoot "<PATH TO CODE>"
		ServerName other.<BASE URL>
		ServerAlias *.* 
	</VirtualHost>
	
	The server alias and server name are very important. Because server alias accepts every *.*, it's 
	a good practice to place this configuration at the end of the VHOST file (to avoid conflict). 


2. In sys.ini, change "ALLOW_DYNAMIC_URL = 0" to "ALLOW_DYNAMIC_URL = 1".

3. Be careful with the login script.
